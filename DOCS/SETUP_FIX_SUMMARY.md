# Setup Fix Summary

## Issue

The `RUN.sh` script was failing with `python: command not found` error when running setup commands.

## Root Cause

The RUN.sh script was using `python` command, but on macOS (and most modern Linux systems), Python 3 is accessed via `python3`.

## Changes Made

### 1. RUN.sh - Updated all Python commands

Changed all `python` commands to `python3`:

- `cmd_setup()` - Line 99: `python3 setup.py`
- `cmd_download()` - Lines 113, 115: `python3 -m cb_downloader`
- `cmd_import()` - Line 129: `python3 localduck/import_to_duckdb.py`
- `cmd_query()` - Line 146: `python3 localduck/query_funding_by_url.py`
- `cmd_bulk()` - Lines 181, 183: `python3 bulk_funding_query.py`
- `cmd_list()` - Line 196: `python3 -m cb_downloader list`
- `cmd_check()` - Line 207: `python3 -m cb_downloader check`
- `cmd_verify()` - Line 218: `python3 -m cb_downloader verify`

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

Added better error handling for virtual environment creation and activation:

```bash
check_venv() {
    if [ ! -d ".venv" ]; then
        echo -e "${YELLOW}Virtual environment not found. Creating...${NC}"
        python3 -m venv .venv || {
            echo -e "${RED}Error: Could not create virtual environment${NC}"
            echo "Please ensure Python 3.8+ is installed"
            exit 1
        }
    fi
    
    echo "Activating virtual environment..."
    source .venv/bin/activate || {
        echo -e "${RED}Error: Could not activate virtual environment${NC}"
        exit 1
    }
}
```

### 3. Added Success Message

Added success message to dependency installation:

```bash
install_deps() {
    # ... installation code ...
    echo -e "${GREEN}✓ Dependencies installed${NC}"
}
```

### 4. SRC/setup.py - Updated all Python commands

Changed all subprocess calls from `python` to `python3`:

- Line 57: Collection check
- Line 86: File verification
- Line 161: Fix corrupted files
- Line 186: Download missing collections
- Line 206: List collections
- Lines 218, 224, 228: Download collections
- Line 279: Import to DuckDB
- Line 286: Query test

### 5. Updated Help Messages

Changed help messages in setup.py to reference RUN.sh commands:

- Line 294: `./RUN.sh query <company-url>`
- Line 296: `./RUN.sh download <collection-name>`

## Testing

Verified that RUN.sh works correctly:

```bash
./RUN.sh help  # ✓ Works correctly
```

## Usage

Now you can run:

```bash
# Complete setup with menu
./RUN.sh setup

# Query a company
./RUN.sh query tesla.com

# Download collections
./RUN.sh download --all

# Import data
./RUN.sh import

# And all other commands...
```

## Notes

- All Python commands now use `python3` for compatibility with macOS and modern Linux
- Better error messages help diagnose issues
- Virtual environment creation has proper error handling
- Setup.py is now integrated properly with RUN.sh
